# CLI_League_Stats

A Ruby CLI app to retrieve a summoner's match history form the League of Legends API. It will then sort the matches by queue, only accounting for match types 400, 420, 430, 440, 450, 700, 830, 840, and 850. It will then list the queues the entered summoner has played games in, and allow the user to select a queue to view the match history, and subsequently select a match to see some basic stats.

## Installation
